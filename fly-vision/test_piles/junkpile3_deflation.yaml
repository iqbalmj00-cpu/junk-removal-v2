# JUNKPILE3: Deflation case (best views ignored, bulky not counted)
pile_id: "JUNKPILE3"
category: "furniture_heavy"

ground_truth:
  min_yd3: 7.0

difficulty:
  occlusion: "medium"
  view_variance: "high"

notes: |
  Deflation test case. System output: 5.76 yd³.
  Root causes: median pile ratio dragged down by far shots,
  bulky items (mattress, bookshelf) not getting volume credit.
  Tests: best-view estimator, bulky priors.
