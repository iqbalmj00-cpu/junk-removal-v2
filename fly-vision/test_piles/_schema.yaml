# Ground Truth Test Pile Schema
#
# Each YAML file represents a test case with:
# - pile_id: Unique identifier
# - category: Type of pile (bags, furniture, mixed, construction, yard_waste)
# - ground_truth: Manual volume estimate with uncertainty range
# - anchors: Known large items that should be detected
# - pass_threshold: Acceptable error margin for this pile

pile_id: "TEMPLATE"
category: "mixed"

ground_truth:
  min_yd3: 5.0      # Lower bound (conservative)
  likely_yd3: 6.5   # Most likely volume
  max_yd3: 8.0      # Upper bound (generous)
  truck_equivalent: "1/2"  # Visual reference

anchors:
  - label: "mattress"
    count: 1
    approx_yd3: 1.2
  - label: "bags"
    count: 10
    approx_yd3: 2.5

difficulty:
  occlusion: "medium"      # none, low, medium, high
  view_variance: "high"    # low, medium, high
  segmentation_risk: "medium"
